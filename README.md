 \
Made by: **Nabeel Ur Rehman Nayyar** \
From: **Pakistan** \
Description: *The project is on Computer Vision and Data analysis, by a suggestion from Mr. Wolfram, I aimed worked on a practical approach which was to use this program to make Video Games for Visually Impared People. Check my Wolfram Community post for more details (https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1732766?p_p_auth=LDXYvA7J)*
 
 
________________________________________________________________________
I was Using Mathematica 12 and no foreign Data was imported in the program instead of the Images required to be analyzed, Make sure change the desired Import location to avoid errors.
